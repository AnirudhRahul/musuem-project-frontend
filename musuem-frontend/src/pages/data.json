Black pottery vessels were wheel-thrown, sometimes to the thinness of an eggshell, blackened during the firing process, and burnished to a high gloss. These delicate objects were impractical for daily use and were likely used for ceremonial purposes. Several Neolithic cultures also fashioned beautiful jades or hard stones \u2014 usually nephrite, an extremely hard mineral native to China \u2014 into ceremonial tools and weapons, ritual objects, or items of personal adornment. These jades were sliced, shaped, perforated, incised, and polished using non-metallic tools and abrasive crystals of even greater hardness than the jade itself, a painstakingly labor-intensive process that only the privileged could afford.", "https://www.harvardartmuseums.org/collections/object/93621", "https://ids.lib.harvard.edu/ids/iiif/47459302"], ["Vase of Flowers", "This is the only still life Seurat is known to have painted, and it is a rare surviving example of his early work, as it is believed that the artist destroyed most of those canvases.

Between 1821 and 1834, ideology and federal policy created a portrait \"event\" that haunts Harvard University and the United States to this day.\r\n\r\nIn 1821, Thomas McKenney, head of the Bureau of Indian Affairs within the War Department, commissioned artist Charles Bird King to begin painting Indigenous delegates and tribal leaders who journeyed to Washington, D.C., in the hopes of reaffirming treaties and seeking redress. In actuality, McKenney wanted (in his words) \"an Indian Gallery\" as a record of \"the aboriginal man\" amid \"the ultimate destruction which awaits his race.\" King produced around 160 portraits over nine years. Like President Andrew Jackson, McKenney promoted the romanticized notion of the United States as a territorial and ideological republic with a \"manifest destiny\" to extend from the Atlantic to the Pacific Ocean. When Jackson signed the Indian Removal Act into law in 1830, the portraits were sent on a multicity tour, representing a nostalgic and inaccurate archive of a \"noble race now passed.\"\r\n\r\nIn 1832, McKenney commissioned Henry Inman to copy King\u2019s portraits. A fire at the Smithsonian in 1865 destroyed most of King\u2019s paintings. The Inman paintings remain a poignant archive of the era\u2019s sentiment and prejudice. In 1889, Harvard\u2019s Peabody Museum of Archaeology and Ethnology was bequeathed 109 of Inman\u2019s portraits in their original gilded frames.\r\n\r\nInman\u2019s portraits after King provide us with a complex, diverse, and imperfect record. Some of the sitters wear western-style suits and display \"peace medals\" given by government officials. Some portraits seem to bear witness to sitters\u2019 self-fashioning and their insistence on accurate representation. Others represent delegates in ensembles that indicate their navigation of, and relationship to, multiple cultures. Our sense is that King made sketches of the sitters\u2019 faces from life and from eyewitness accounts. He later relied on memory or McKenney\u2019s descriptions to approximate and \"stage\" the backgrounds and much of the delegates\u2019 dress and poses. McKenney touted the portraits as typological tools to visually distinguish \"civilized\" tribes who had assimilated from \"uncivilized\" tribes. The paintings were intended to justify the forced displacement and removal of Indigenous populations from the eastern United States, serving as illustrations of those nations whose pride, prominence, and wealth were a threat. \r\n\r\nII. Difficult Histories / Unstable Objects / New Meanings: Conservation as a Mode of Respect\r\n\r\nIn the 1930s, the Inman paintings were removed from their original frames and put into wood frames painted to imitate expensive veneer. The paintings were also cut from their original tacking and underwent excessive overcleaning. This permanent damage to the supports and paint layers repressed the identifying characteristics of the sitters and much of Inman\u2019s celebrated brushwork. A second treatment in the early 1970s could not mitigate the degraded paint layers. In 1979, the Peabody deaccessioned the paintings. All but 27 were sold.\r\n\r\nIn 2019, a collaboration began between the Straus Center for Conservation and Technical Studies at the Harvard Art Museums and the Peabody Museum\u2019s Collections Division and Conservation Department. Eight paintings were chosen to initiate an ongoing conservation and research project. Straus conservators have led these efforts in concert with doctoral studentsfrom the Harvard Art Museums\u2019 Summer Institute for Technical Studies in Art (SITSA). Thanks to a team of faculty, staff, and students, these works are now being transitioned into the Harvard Art Museums collections. The stories of these objects are ongoing, just as the presence and experiences of Native persons in the Americas are ongoing.\r\n\r\nOver the next few years, the revitalized portraits will cycle through these two frames in the gallery. In the accompanying labels, the sitter\u2019s form of address attached to each portrait will be kept in brackets. We are doing this because the names were written phonetically from McKenney\u2019s memory, with little care whether the name was a given name, a chosen name, or an awarded name, or if it was a ceremonial honorific or pejorative nickname given by U.S. officials. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\u3000\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\u3000\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\u3000\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\u3000\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\u3000\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\u3000\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\u3000", "https://www.harvardartmuseums.org/collections/object/333003", "https://ids.lib.harvard.edu/ids/iiif/435943195"], ["Colonel Ernst August von Hugo and Lt.

These three bowls demonstrate the impact of Chinese luxury wares that arrived in the Abbasid capital in the late eighth century. Inspired by the prestigious white-bodied imports from China, potters in the port town of Basra covered their own earthenware with a tin glaze that fired opaque white. They soon began to transform their white-ground vessels with the addition of colors.\r\nTo create the green-splashed effect, copper ran in the glaze during firing, a technique that appears in both Abbasid and Tang dynasty (618\u2013907) wares. Ceramics decorated with cobalt blue on white were first produced by eighth-century potters in China, but the development of floral patterns in the blue-on-white idiom seems to have originated with Islamic potters. One of the most significant innovations attributed to Basra potters was the application of luster painting to ceramics. In this technique, the artist painted metal oxides onto an already glazed and fired surface. After a second firing in a low-oxygen atmosphere kiln, the design was deposited on the glaze as an iridescent stain.", "https://www.harvardartmuseums.org/collections/object/147861", "https://ids.lib.harvard.edu/ids/iiif/18481791"], ["Notched, Serrate Jade Disk", "\r\nIn Neolithic China, nephrite and other beautiful stones were fashioned into nonfunctional ceremonial blades and ritual implements that were buried in the graves of important people.

The work assumes the gaze of future generations and anticipates ongoing evaluation and reflection as new associations, lessons, and questions emerge. Between 1821 and 1834, ideology and federal policy created a portrait \"event\" that haunts Harvard University and the United States to this day.\r\n\r\nIn 1821, Thomas McKenney, head of the Bureau of Indian Affairs within the War Department, commissioned artist Charles Bird King to begin painting Indigenous delegates and tribal leaders who journeyed to Washington, D.C., in the hopes of reaffirming treaties and seeking redress. In actuality, McKenney wanted (in his words) \"an Indian Gallery\" as a record of \"the aboriginal man\" amid \"the ultimate destruction which awaits his race.\" King produced around 160 portraits over nine years. Like President Andrew Jackson, McKenney promoted the romanticized notion of the United States as a territorial and ideological republic with a \"manifest destiny\" to extend from the Atlantic to the Pacific Ocean. When Jackson signed the Indian Removal Act into law in 1830, the portraits were sent on a multicity tour, representing a nostalgic and inaccurate archive of a \"noble race now passed.\"\r\n\r\nIn 1832, McKenney commissioned Henry Inman to copy King\u2019s portraits.

Some portraits seem to bear witness to sitters\u2019 self-fashioning and their insistence on accurate representation. Others represent delegates in ensembles that indicate their navigation of, and relationship to, multiple cultures. Our sense is that King made sketches of the sitters\u2019 faces from life and from eyewitness accounts.

Difficult Histories / Unstable Objects / New Meanings: Conservation as a Mode of Respect\r\n\r\nIn the 1930s, the Inman paintings were removed from their original frames and put into wood frames painted to imitate expensive veneer. The paintings were also cut from their original tacking and underwent excessive overcleaning. This permanent damage to the supports and paint layers repressed the identifying characteristics of the sitters and much of Inman\u2019s celebrated brushwork. A second treatment in the early 1970s could not mitigate the degraded paint layers. In 1979, the Peabody deaccessioned the paintings. All but 27 were sold.\r\n\r\nIn 2019, a collaboration began between the Straus Center for Conservation and Technical Studies at the Harvard Art Museums and the Peabody Museum\u2019s Collections Division and Conservation Department. Eight paintings were chosen to initiate an ongoing conservation and research project. Straus conservators have led these efforts in concert with doctoral studentsfrom the Harvard Art Museums\u2019 Summer Institute for Technical Studies in Art (SITSA). Thanks to a team of faculty, staff, and students, these works are now being transitioned into the Harvard Art Museums collections. The stories of these objects are ongoing, just as the presence and experiences of Native persons in the Americas are ongoing.\r\n\r\nOver the next few years, the revitalized portraits will cycle through these two frames in the gallery.
